# Reverse List
Write a function called reverseArray which
takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing
any of the built-in methods available to your
language, return an array with elements in
reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I iterated through the list in reverse order,
beginning with the highest index. For each
each index, the item is appended to a new _result_
array.

Time: O(n), n = number of items in the array
Space: O(n), a new array is created the same
size as the original, where n = number of items
in the array.
